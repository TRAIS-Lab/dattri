    The LOO groundtruth is directly calculated by calculating the target value

    Args:
        target_func (Callable): The target function that takes a model and a dataloader
            and returns the target value. An example of a target function like follows:

        test_dataloader (torch.utils.data.DataLoader): The dataloader where each of
            the samples is used as the test set.

        Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]: A tuple of two tensors. First is the LOO
            groundtruth values for each sample in test_dataloader and each model in
            retrain_dir. The returned tensor has the shape
            (num_models, num_test_samples).

            the shape (num_models,).
